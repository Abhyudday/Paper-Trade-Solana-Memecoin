## Uptime Monitoring

The bot includes built-in uptime monitoring to keep it alive on Railway and prevent it from going to sleep.

### Built-in HTTP Server

The bot now runs a simple HTTP server that responds to health check requests:

- **Root endpoint**: `https://your-bot.railway.app/`
- **Health endpoint**: `https://your-bot.railway.app/health`
- **Ping endpoint**: `https://your-bot.railway.app/ping`

All endpoints return "Bot is alive! üöÄ" with a 200 status code.

### Environment Variables for Uptime Monitoring

Add these to your Railway environment variables:

```bash
# Enable/disable uptime monitoring (default: true)
UPTIME_MONITORING_ENABLED=true

# Ping interval in seconds (default: 300 = 5 minutes)
UPTIME_PING_INTERVAL=300

# Comma-separated list of uptime monitoring service URLs
# Example: https://uptimerobot.com/ping/your-monitor-id
UPTIME_URLS=https://your-uptime-service.com/ping/your-id
```
